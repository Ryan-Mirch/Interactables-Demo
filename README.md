# Interaction Examples

You will find three examples of how to set up interaction in Godot.

Each example contains its own README file that describes how the project works, and the trade-offs of each implementation. Each demo builds of the previous one and increases complexity.

- `Simple Demo` uses a script on the interactable objects
- `Inheritance Demo` uses a base class that all interactables extend from
- `Composition Demo` uses a composited node that you nest under an object to make it interactive

Have fun!
